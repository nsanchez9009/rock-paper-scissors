##ROCK PAPER SCISSORS
---
Rock paper scissors game where you play against a computer. First to 5 points wins!
<br><br>
Using JavaScript, I was able to update my previous rock paper scissors game and give it a user interface. You can now select what move you will make with your mouse, view the computers move, and view the score of the current game. Once either you or the computer reach 5 points, you will be alerted with a message letting you know if you win or lose.
